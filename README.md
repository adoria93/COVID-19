# COVID-19

The first major news story of 2020 was the outbreak of a new coronavirus in Wuhan, China. Classified as COVID-19 by the WHO, this disease has quickly spread throughout the world. Of interest to me was seeing how the world is dealing with this outbreak, by looking at the total number of reported cases as well as the recoveries and deaths. More importantly, seeing if there is a difference in the way countries are handling the outbreak.
* China
* Italy
* United States

I chose these three countries to focus on because China is where everything started, Italy was one of the first countries outside of China to be seriously impacted by COVID-19 and the United States is in the early states of dealing with the outbreak.
